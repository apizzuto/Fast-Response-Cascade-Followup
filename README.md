== Fast Response Cascade Followup ==

This repository contains the scripts for analyzing a set of archival HESE cascades using the Fast Response Analysis. The plan is to follow up future alerts in real time, but first we wanted to check the sensitivity of such an analysis.

All relevant figures are saved in the `figures/` directory, and the analysis will eventually be run in real time using code that can be found on [Github](https://github.com/IceCubeOpenSource/FastResponseAnalysis).
